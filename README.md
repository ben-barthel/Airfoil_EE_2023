For flowfield analysis:
1. Wavelet/Foruer transformed vorticity on boundary is generated with visualize_EE_vorticity.m
2. 3D plots are generated with generate_3D_plot.m - this requires data generated by visualize_EE_vorticity.m


For neurel network:
1. save_Wavelet_Database.m generates wavelet preprcoessed surface pressure data
2. run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN.py trains network for user defined sensor locations
3. run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN_active_Search.py runs active search to find optima lsensor locations
