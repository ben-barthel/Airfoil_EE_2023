For Flowfield Analysis:
1. Wavelet/Foruer transformed vorticity on boundary is generated with visualize_EE_vorticity.m
2. 3D plots are generated with generate_3D_plot.m - this requires data generated by visualize_EE_vorticity.m
3. Active search script 'run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN_active_Search.py' is best run on a HPC everything else is laptop friendly


For offline sensor placment results
1. 'OMI_Search.m' runs offline mutual information sensor placment
2. The code for the NN model can be fond at https://github.com/snagcliffs/Airfoil_EE


For Wavelet Model:
General: 
1. Model is run and trained in python using TensorFlow. The python codes train and run the model and save output, the figures are generated using the matlab codes.
2. 'save_wavelet_basis.m' generates wavelet preprcoessed surface pressure data

To simply run the ensemble model
1. 'run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN.py' trains model and plots output

For basis comparisson results
1. 'run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN_basis_test.py' trains network using all basis types
2. 'generate_plots_basis_comp_1.m' generates time series and pdf plots
3. 'generate_plots_basis_comp_2.m' generates error metric plots

For active search results
1. 'run_wavelet_processed_ensemble_NN_active_Search.py' runs active search to find optimal sensor locations
2. 'generate_plots_active_search.m' generates plots
